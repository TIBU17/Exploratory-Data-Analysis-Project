Exploratory Data Analysis on Layoffs Dataset
Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a global layoffs dataset to uncover patterns and trends across industries, companies, countries, and time.

Analyzed layoffs by year and month to identify peak periods and economic downturn impacts.

Investigated top affected industries, countries, and companies using aggregation and ranking techniques.

Created summary statistics and visualizations (if applicable) to highlight distributions, trends, and outliers.

Derived actionable insights such as the relationship between funding and layoffs, and the percentage of companies with full staff reductions.

Supported findings with data storytelling, laying the groundwork for future predictive modeling or reporting.
